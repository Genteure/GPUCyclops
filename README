Cyclops - one-eyed robot
This project was started on November 17th, 2012 by C. Tapang.

Summary:
Use each frame of an MP4/H264 video stream to determine the location of the camera at the instant that frame was taken.
The location is determined by comparing each camera frame to a number of renderings of the model of the world.
Extract motion vectors from the MP4/H264 stream. Use those to glean where the camera is going, and where it is being aimed at.
